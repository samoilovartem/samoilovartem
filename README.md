<h1 align="center"> ðŸš€ Hi there, </h1>

I'm a passionate and results-driven Python developer with a proven track record of delivering high-quality, scalable solutions across diverse industries. With a strong foundation in web application development, CI/CD processes, and team leadership, I thrive on transforming complex business requirements into innovative technical solutions.

Currently, I'm spearheading service development and architectural strategies at InteleTravel.com, where I've enhanced deployment efficiency and software quality through robust CI/CD frameworks. My journey has also seen me lead a dynamic team at Lew & Dowski Capital, LLC, where I played a pivotal role in launching a consignment portal for reselling season tickets.

With expertise in Django, FastAPI, AWS, and more, I excel in both backend development and cross-functional collaboration. I'm dedicated to continuous learning and professional growth, currently pursuing a Master's degree in IT to further refine my skill set and stay ahead of industry trends.

Outside of coding, I enjoy mentoring upcoming developers, fostering teamwork, and exploring the latest advancements in AI and automation.
