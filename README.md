As a Python backend developer, I bring a strong commitment to crafting efficient, high-performance code. I am always eager to further enhance my backend development skills in a dynamic and innovative environment that utilizes cutting-edge technology. Beyond my technical skills, I also bring a proven track record in conceptualizing and developing projects from ground zero, designing each detail with a results-oriented mindset.

**Core Competencies:**

- Proficiency in Django, FastAPI, DRF, Flask, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLAlchemy, Docker, CI/CD (Heroku, Google Cloud)
- Solid grasp of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, ensuring fluid collaboration with front-end teams.

In my current role at Lew & Dowski, I effectively manage a team of 4, fostering an environment of collaboration and consistent high-quality output. My professional journey is fueled by a passion for learning and a dedication to the success of the organisations I work with.

Please feel free to reach me out to discuss my qualifications and how I can contribute your team/business.
